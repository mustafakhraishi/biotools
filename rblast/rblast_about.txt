rBLAST is a bioinformatics tool that will convert RNA mass to moles, calculate the moles of RNA ends, the number of RNA molecules 
and its molecular weight. The tool will also convert RNA moles to mass.  

A number of different formulas are adopted in this program: 

For mass to moles:
- moles ssRNA (mol) = mass of ssRNA (g)/((length of ssRNA (nt) x 321.47 g/mol) + 18.02 g/mol)
- moles of ssRNA ends = moles ssRNA (mol)
- RNA copy number = moles of ssRNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol

â€‹For moles to mass:
- mass of ssRNA (g) = moles of ssRNA (mol) x ((length of ssRNA (nt) x 321.47 g/mol/nt) + 18.02 g/mol)


RNA Mass to Moles

The molecular weight of RNA = (number of nucleotides of RNA x average molecular weight of a nucleotide) + 18.02 g/mol

If no RNA sequence in inputted, the average molecular weight of a ribonucleotide  = 321.47 g/mol will be adopted, 
excluding the water molecule removed during polymerization.

When a sequence is provided, the exact molecular weight is calculated by summing the molecular weights of the individual nucleotides:

Adenosine (A): 313.23
Uracil (U): 306.16
Guanine (G): 329.23
Cytosine (C): 289.20

These weights exclude the water molecule removed during polymerization and 18.02 g/mol is added for the -OH and -H 
added back to the ends.

RNA copy number
- Avagadro's Number = 6.022e23 molecules/mol
