xClean is a bioinformatics software that will formâ€‹at an inputted DNA or RNA sequence and return a clean version. 
Simply, type or copy and paste a sequence into the field above and click format. 

All non-nucleotide letters, invalid characters (e.g. !, $, ?, /) and numbers are removed from the inputted sequence. 
If sequences are inputted in lowercase then they will be converted to uppercase and be displayed in the form of triplet nucleotides.

The tool formats DNA or RNA so only characters representing DNA or RNA nucleotides will be recognized. 
DNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T).  
RNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Uracil (U). 
This tool does not distinguish between the orientation of DNA or RNA, sequences can be entered in a 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' direction.
