sBLAST is a bioinformatics tool that will convert ssDNA mass to moles, calculate the moles of ssDNA ends, 
the number of DNA molecules and its molecular weight. The tool will also convert ssDNA moles to mass.  

A number of different formulas are adopted in this program: 

For mass to moles:
- moles ssDNA (mol) = mass of ssDNA (g)/((length of ssDNA (nt) x 308.97 g/mol/nt) + 18.02 g/mol)
- moles of ssDNA ends = moles ssDNA (mol)
- DNA copy number = moles of ssDNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol

For moles to mass:
- mass of ssDNA (g) = moles of ssDNA (mol) x ((length of ssDNA (nt) x 308.97 g/mol/bp) + 18.02 g/mol)


ssDNA Mass to Moles

â€‹Molecular weight of ssDNA = (number of deoxynucleotide monophosphates of ssDNA x average molecular weight of a deoxynucleotide 
monophosphate) + 18.02 g/mol.

If no DNA sequence in inputted, the average molecular weight of a deoxynucleotide monophosphate = 308.97 g/mol will be adopted, 
excluding the water molecule removed during polymerization. The term 18.02 g/mol accounts for the -OH and -H added back to the ends.

When a sequence is provided, the exact molecular weight is calculated by summing the molecular weights of the individual nucleotides:

Adenosine (A): 313.23
Thymine (T): 304.21
Guanine (G): 329.23
Cytosine (C): 289.20

These weights exclude the water molecule removed during polymerization and 18.02 g/mol is added for the -OH and -H added 
back to the ends.
