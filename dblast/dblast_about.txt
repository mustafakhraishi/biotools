dBLAST is a bioinformatics tool that will convert dsDNA mass to moles, calculate the moles of dsDNA ends, the number of 
DNA molecules and its molecular weight. The tool will also convert dsDNA moles to mass.  

A number of different formulas are adopted in this program: 

For mass to moles:
- moles dsDNA (mol) = mass of dsDNA (g)/((length of dsDNA (bp) x 617.96 g/mol/bp) + 36.04 g/mol)
- moles of dsDNA ends = moles dsDNA (mol) x 2
- DNA copy number = moles of dsDNA x 6.022e23 molecules/mol

For moles to mass:
- mass of dsDNA (g) = moles of dsDNA (mol) x ((length of dsDNA (bp) x 617.96 g/mol/bp) + 36.04 g/mol)


​dsDNA Mass to Moles

Molecular weight of dsDNA = (number of base pairs of dsDNA x average molecular weight of a base pair) + 36.04 g/mol.

If no DNA sequence in inputted, the average molecular weight of a deoxynucleotide monophosphate = 617.96 g/mol will be adopted, 
excluding the water molecule removed during polymerization.

When a sequence is provided, the exact molecular weight is calculated by summing the molecular weights of the individual nucleotides:

Adenosine (A): 313.23
Thymine (T): 304.21
Guanine (G): 329.23
Cytosine (C): 289.20

​These weights exclude the water molecule removed during polymerization and 36.024 g/mol is added for the -OH and -H added back to the ends.

DNA copy number
- Avagadro's Number = 6.022e23 molecules/mol
