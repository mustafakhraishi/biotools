OptiBind has been created to calculate the optimal annealing temperature (Ta) of a pair of primers based on the nearest neighbour 
modelling for their respective melting temperatures (Tm).

The nearest neighbour model considers the entropy and enthalpy of nucleotides based upon their specific arrangement in the 
DNA sequence. These values can then be adjusted for salt and primer concentrations to output a melting temperature. Information 
about the sequence length and G-C content are also provided.
