Tempify is a quick and easy-to-use online calculator that converts between Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit. 
Simply enter a temperature, select the unit and the desired converted unit and the calculator will return a converted temperature.

Celsius
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (9/5)C + 32
- Celsius to Kelvin: K = C + 273.15

Fahrenheit
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F - 32) * (5/9)
- Fahrenheit to Kelvin: K = (F + 459.67) * (5/9)

Kelvin
- Kelvin to Fahrenheit: F = K * (9/5) - 459.67
- Kelvin to Celsius: C = K - 273.15


The formulas for converting between temperature scales are based on the relationships between the three scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

These formulas assume that the size of the temperature unit (degree) is the same for all three scales.
- C is the temperature in Celsius
- F is the temperature in Fahrenheit
- K is the temperature in Kelvin

The formulas also use basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
These operations are used to convert the temperature from one scale to another by multiplying or dividing by constants and 
adding or subtracting offsets.
