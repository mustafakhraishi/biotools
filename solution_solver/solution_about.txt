Solution Solver was designed to make everyday dilution calculations quicker and easier to perform. 
Enter the stock solution concentration, desired final concentration and final solution volumes and 
this program will calculate how much of the stock solution's volume is required to obtain the desired final concentration. 

The formula for calculating a dilution is (C1) (V1) = (C2) (V2) where...
- C1 is the concentration of the starting solution.
- V1 is the volume of the starting solution.
- C2 is the concentration of the final solution.
- V2 is the volume of the final solution.

This program enables the the user to select a wide range of concentrations and volumes from molar to femtomolar and from litres to femtoliters. 
Values can be inputted for the stock solution concentration (C1), desired final concentration (C2) and the total final solution volume (V2). 
Result will be displayed for the required stock solution (V1). The desired concentration must be greater than the stock concentration.
