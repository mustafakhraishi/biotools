Melt Assistant finds the melting temperature of a unique DNA sequence using basic and salt-adjusted equations. 
Both approaches consider the type of nucleotide in the specific DNA sequence. 
The salt-adjusted method takes into account the concentration of Sodium (Na+) ions. 

The formulas used for calculating the melting temperature of a DNA sequence depends on the sequence's length. 

Basic:

For sequences less than 14 nucleotides the formula is:
- Tm = (wA + xT) * 2 + (yG + zC) * 4
-- where w,x,y,z are the number of the bases A,T,G,C in the sequence, respectively.

For sequences longer than 14 nucleotides, the equation used is:
- Tm = 64.9 + 41 * (yG + zC - 16.4) / (wA + xT + yG + zC)


​Salt-Adjusted:

​For sequences less than 14 nucleotides the formula is:
- Tm = (wA+xT) * 2 + (yG+zC) * 4 - log10(0.050) + 16.6*log10([Na+])
-- where w,x,y,z are the number of the bases A,T,G,C in the sequence, respectively.

​For sequences longer than 14 nucleotides, the equation used is:
- Tm = 100.5 + (41 * (yG+zC) / (wA+xT+yG+zC)) - (820 / (wA+xT+yG+zC)) + 16.6*log10([Na+])
