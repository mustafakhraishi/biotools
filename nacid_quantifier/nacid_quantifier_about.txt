The nACID Quantifier is a tool that calculates the concentration of DNA or RNA in a solution. It does this by using the molecular 
weight, extinction coefficient, and the wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) of the DNA or RNA. The λmax is the specific 
wavelength at which a substance absorbs the most light, and for DNA, this is typically 260 nm.

ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA
- concentration = (absorbance * dilutionFactor * standardConcentration) / pathlength

ssOLIGO​
- concentration = (absorbance / (extinctionCoefficient * pathlength)) * molecularWeight * dilutionFactor


​Empirical Rules
There are certain empirical rules that can be used to estimate the concentration of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) based on their 
absorbance at 260 nm (OD260). These rules state that:

- An OD260 value of 1 corresponds to a concentration of 50 μg/ml for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
- An OD260 value of 1 corresponds to a concentration of 33 μg/ml for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
- An OD260 value of 1 corresponds to a concentration of 20 μg/ml for single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides
- An OD260 value of 1 corresponds to a concentration of 40 μg/ml for RNA

To calculate the molecular weight of a nucleic acid molecule, the following values are used to determine the weight of each individual nucleotide (g/mol) after the protecting groups are removed:

For DNA:
A: 313.21
C: 289.18
G: 329.21
T:  304.20
