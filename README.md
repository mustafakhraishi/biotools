# Life Science Calculators

A collection of simple online calculators to assist you in performing life science experiments. Perform various calculations, analyze sequences, and predict melting temperatures with ease.

## Features
**Sequence Formatter (xClean)**: Enter a DNA or RNA sequence and receive a formatted version.


**Dilutions (Solution Solver)**: Calculate the volume required to dilute a substance to a desired concentration in solution.


**Concentration (Molecule Maker)**: Determine the mass of a substance for creating a solution or the molarity of a known mass.


**Nearest Neighbour Tm (Melt Master)**: Predict the melting temperature of DNA using the nearest neighbour model.


**Basic & Salt-Adjusted Tm (Melt Assistant)**: Predict the melting temperature of DNA using the basic and salt-adjusted model.


**Oligo Analyser (Oligo Inspector)**: Analyze a DNA sequence to discover its composition, complement, and reverse sequences.


**Moles & Mass of ssDNA (sBLAST)**: Calculate the mass or moles of ssDNA based on its length and nucleotide composition.


**Moles & Mass of dsDNA (dBLAST)**: Calculate the mass or moles of dsDNA based on its length and nucleotide composition.


**Moles & Mass of RNA (rBLAST)**: Calculate the mass or moles of RNA based on its length and nucleotide composition.


**Primer Melting Temperatures (PrimerX)**: Check the properties and melting temperature of primers using a nearest neighbour model.


**Optimal Annealing Temperature (OptiBind)**: Compute the optimal annealing temperature of a pair of primers for PCR.


**Primer Mutations & PCR Tm (Mutation Miner)**: Determine the effect of point mutations and mismatches on the melting temperature of primers.


**Temperature Converter (Tempify)**: Quickly convert between Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius.


**Absorption & Nucleic Acid Concentration (nACID Quantifier)**: Quantify the concentration of DNA or RNA based on its absorption.
