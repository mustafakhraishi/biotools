Melt Master finds the melting temperature of a unique DNA sequence using nearest neighbour modelling (NNM). 
The nearest neighbour model considers the entropy and enthalpy of nucleotides based upon their specific arrangement in the DNA sequence. 
These values can then be adjusted for salt and primer concentrations to output a melting temperature. 

The formulas used for calculating the melting temperature based on a DNA sequence is: 
- Melting Temperature (Tm) = (1000 x ΔH) / (ΔS + R ln (DNA /2)) - 273.15

The melting temperature (Tm) is a measure of the temperature at which the double-stranded DNA structure of a molecule begins to 
denature and separate into single strands. The Tm is calculated using the following formula: 
Tm = (1000 x ΔH) / (ΔS + R ln (DNA /2)) - 273.15, 
where ΔH is the enthalpy of melting, ΔS is the entropy of melting, R is the gas constant, 
and DNA is the concentration of the DNA molecule. 

The term "1000" is a conversion factor that converts the units of ΔH from 
calories per mol to joules per mol. The term "R" is a constant value that is used in the formula to calculate the Tm. 
The term "ln" is the natural logarithm function, which is used to calculate the logarithm of the DNA concentration value. 
The term "2" is a constant value that is used in the formula to calculate the Tm. 
The term "-273.15" is a conversion factor that converts the units of temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Kelvin.
