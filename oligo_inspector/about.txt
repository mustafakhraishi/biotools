Oligo Inspector analyzes the properties of a unique nucleic acid sequence (DNA or RNA). 
The program first formats the inputted sequence and then provides the complement sequence, reverse sequence and reverse complement. 
Additional properties of the nucleic acid sequence such as the length, base composition, G-C content and molecular weight 
is also computed and displayed. 

The percent of G-C bases are calculated using the number of Guanine (G) or Cytosine (C) bases as a function 
of the total sequence length. The molecular weight is derived by summing all the individual nucleotides in a sequence. 

â€‹The tool formats DNA or RNA so only characters representing DNA or RNA nucleotides will be recognized. DNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), 
Guanine (G) and Thymine (T).  RNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Uracil (U). Enter a sequence in the 5' to 3' direction. 
To calculate the molecular weight of a nucleic acid molecule, the following values are used to determine the weight of each 
individual nucleotide (g/mol) after the protecting groups are removed:

For DNA:

A: 313.21
C: 289.18
G: 329.21
T:  304.20

For RNA:

A: 313.21
C: 289.18
G: 329.21
U: 306.17
